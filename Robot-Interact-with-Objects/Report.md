# Task3


# Note :
**the code has three animation as required**

* the code here implement the robot inside the room which has bed and bookshelvs and he moves with  a ball inside it ^_^.
* the first one as the robot move his hands and legs without moving the whole robot --> this can be achieved only when the line zdistance in the timer function is 10 not zdistance
* the second animation is the robot move and his hand and leg --> this can be achieved only when the object called ball is commented
* the third animation is the robot move with the ball as this animation can achieved when the code is run as it is.



**Summary**


* The idea in this code as in task1 & task2 to make the body parts then using camera.
* Scaling the cube & objects in order to make the orientation of body parts.
* Adding push and pull commands in order to save the location for example when we drew the new objects we need the position of other object to start from this point.
* adding functions to rotate,normalize,crossproduct,lookup,lookdown,lookleft,lookright,moveforward,movebackward.
* the new here is to load objects & make texture to the floor.

**Problems We Face**

>while creating the texture, robot and the texture not included in the same window

>There were some difficulties imagining the axes of rotation and directions.

>when using the ball and the robot the problem here is that to make a synchronize with the ball.

>when starting to make the animation the probelm here is at what can make changes on the robot, therefore, the only change is at about the angles.

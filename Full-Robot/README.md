**Problems We Face**

>while creating the robot body is that to start from the body, build on the limbs, then had to go back to the body setting to start creating the next limb solving it
by pushing the body setting 5 times to the stack in the first, then keep poping them one after another to create the 4 limbs and the head.

>There were some difficulties imagining the axes of rotation and directions

>while making the camera the problem here is at at which location in the code we put the function glLookAt(), asking colleage about this then finally know that is at the display function.

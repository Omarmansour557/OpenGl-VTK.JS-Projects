**Summary**


* The idea in this code is to how to rotate the arm or finger so in the  code there are alot of commands as Translate Rotate Translate (TRT) in order to rotate around the origin and then translate to the target position. 

* Scaling the cube in order to make the orientation of finger and arm.

* Adding push and pull commands in order to save the location for example when we drew the elbow we need the position of shoulder to start from this point
* Note : we leave the shoulder around 360 degree in order to see all orientation of the arm.

**Problems We Face**

>As when we rotate one finger the other fingers also rotates. Solution is to put push and pull between each finger in order to save it.

>As when we need to control the finger to rotate untill it reaches to 90 and fingure can't able to return back due to presence of wrong condition in if statement. Solution

> We need to make The fingerer at the edge of elbow so we face some problems to calculate it but when we imagine it on the paper outside it seems very easy.

# Robotic-Arm

**Summary**


> Rotating the arm or finger using Translate Rotate Translate (TRT) in order to rotate around the origin and then translate to the target position. 

> Scaling the cube in order to make the orientation of finger and arm.

> Adding push and pull commands in order to save the location for example when we drew the elbow we need the position of shoulder to start from this point

> Note : we leave the shoulder around 360 degree in order to see all orientation of the arm.
